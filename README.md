===============================

Running the game:
Download the zip file and open index.html to run the game in your browser.

Instructions:
This game is pretty simple at this point.  You start at the bottom of the screen and can move around using the arrow keys on the keyboard.  Water is impassable, but you can move on the stones and grass.  Try to avoid the bugs and if you collide with one, you will be placed at the beginning location.  Future enhancements could include items to pick up, a scoring system, sounds, and more variety of sprites for the enemies.
